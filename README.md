# Ham radio sweets

This is a set of code etudes on radio engineering. These pieces of code were written for different purposes. Sometimes the point was to help me solve my job tasks, sometimes coding was driven by interest or research passion. All code here is correct in terms of physics unless some limitations are explicitly pointed.
